# 3D Modelling

## Ideas

First idea

The first idea I came up with was to create a scence which had an igloo and snow and a few extra items around and in the igloo.

Second idea

Browsing around on sketchfab, I came across this model.
This caused me to think 'It would look interesting having one half of the scene as snow and the other half with rocks and lava.'
